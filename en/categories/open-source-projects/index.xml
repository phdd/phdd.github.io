      <description>TL;DR The Neo4j1 Browser2 is a great tool for querying a graph and comes with a well designed user interface that supports data visualization and iterative exploration. But in terms of manipulation, the user has to write Cypher3-queries, respectively knowing the language in detail. I forked the GitHub-Project4 and extended the user interface for the sake of visual data manipulation. This allow rapid model prototyping and evolution without querying the graph with Cypher.</description>

      <description>As described in the Getting Things Done methodology we have to cope with a large amount of incoming information; E-mails are outdated, but still heavily used. They are trapped in our client software, only transferable by copy and paste. Thus we need a way to import those into our favorite project management system to actually get things done.
Working with Taiga and Thunderbird for quite a while now, I managed to write a thunderbird extension for this very purpose.</description>
