But in terms of manipulation, the user has to write Cypher3-queries, respectively knowing the language in detail. I forked the GitHub-Project4 and extended the user interface for the sake of visual data manipulation. This allow rapid model prototyping and evolution without querying the graph with Cypher.</description></item><item><title>Thunderbird Taiga Integration</title><link>https://peter.heisig.rocks/en/posts/thunderbird-taiga-integration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peter.heisig.rocks/en/posts/thunderbird-taiga-integration/</guid><description>As described in the Getting Things Done methodology we have to cope with a large amount of incoming information; E-mails are outdated, but still heavily used. They are trapped in our client software, only transferable by copy and paste. Thus we need a way to import those into our favorite project management system to actually get things done.
Working with Taiga and Thunderbird for quite a while now, I managed to write a thunderbird extension for this very purpose.</description></item><item><title>Legal Disclosure</title><link>https://peter.heisig.rocks/en/imprint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peter.heisig.rocks/en/imprint/</guid><description>Information in accordance with Section 5 TMG Peter Heisig
